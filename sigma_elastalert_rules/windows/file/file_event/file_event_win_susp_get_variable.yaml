  Get-Variable is a valid PowerShell cmdlet
  WindowsApps is by default in the path where PowerShell is executed.
  So when the Get-Variable command is issued on PowerShell execution, the system first looks for the Get-Variable executable in the path and executes the malicious binary instead of looking for the PowerShell cmdlet.
