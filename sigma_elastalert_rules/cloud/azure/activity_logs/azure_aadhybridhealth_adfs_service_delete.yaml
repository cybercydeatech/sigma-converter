  This detection uses azureactivity logs (Administrative category) to identify the deletion of an Azure AD Hybrid health AD FS service instance in a tenant.
  A threat actor can create a new AD Health ADFS service and create a fake server to spoof AD FS signing logs.
  The health AD FS service can then be deleted after it is not longer needed via HTTP requests to Azure.
