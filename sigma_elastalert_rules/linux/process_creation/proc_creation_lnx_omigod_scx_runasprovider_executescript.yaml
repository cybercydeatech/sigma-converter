  Rule to detect the use of the SCX RunAsProvider ExecuteScript to execute any UNIX/Linux script using the /bin/sh shell.
  Script being executed gets created as a temp file in /tmp folder with a scx* prefix.
  Then it is invoked from the following directory /etc/opt/microsoft/scx/conf/tmpdir/.
  The file in that directory has the same prefix scx*. SCXcore, started as the Microsoft Operations Manager UNIX/Linux Agent, is now used in a host of products including
  Microsoft Operations Manager, Microsoft Azure, and Microsoft Operations Management Suite.
